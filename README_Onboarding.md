# Onboarding Screen Implementation

## Overview
The car safety app now includes a fully localized onboarding screen that appears every time the app starts, with a skip option for users who want to bypass the tutorial.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Always Show Onboarding**
- Modified `splash_screen.dart` to always navigate to the onboarding screen
- The onboarding now shows on every app launch instead of just first-time users

### 2. **Skip Option**
- Added a "Skip" button in the top-right corner of each onboarding page
- Skip button uses localized text: "דלג" (Hebrew) / "Skip" (English)
- Skipping bypasses the tutorial and goes directly to the home screen
- Skipping does NOT mark onboarding as completed, ensuring it shows again next time

### 3. **Complete Localization**
All onboarding content is fully localized in both Hebrew and English:

#### Onboarding Pages:
1. **Welcome Page**
   - Hebrew: "ברוכים הבאים למערכת בטיחות הרכב"
   - English: "Welcome to Car Safety System"

2. **Detection Page**
   - Hebrew: "זיהוי אוטומטי"
   - English: "Automatic Detection"

3. **Alerts Page**
   - Hebrew: "התראות חכמות"
   - English: "Smart Alerts"

4. **Setup Page**
   - Hebrew: "הגדרת המערכת"
   - English: "System Setup"

#### Navigation Buttons:
- **Previous**: "הקודם" / "Previous"
- **Next**: "הבא" / "Next"
- **Start**: "התחל" / "Start"
- **Skip**: "דלג" / "Skip"

### 4. **User Flow**
1. App launches → Splash Screen (2 seconds)
2. Automatically navigates to Onboarding Screen
3. User can either:
   - Navigate through all 4 pages and click "Start" (marks onboarding as completed)
   - Click "Skip" at any point (does NOT mark as completed)
4. Both actions navigate to Home Screen

### 5. **Language Support**
- The onboarding screen respects the user's language selection
- Text direction is automatically adjusted (RTL for Hebrew, LTR for English)
- All UI elements, buttons, and content are dynamically translated
- Users can change language in Settings and see onboarding in the new language on next launch

### 6. **Visual Design**
- Each page has a unique icon and color scheme
- Progress indicators show current page
- Clean, modern design with proper spacing
- Responsive layout that works on different screen sizes

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `lib/screens/onboarding_screen.dart` - Added skip button and functionality
- `lib/screens/splash_screen.dart` - Modified to always show onboarding
- `lib/l10n/app_localizations.dart` - Contains base localization keys
- `lib/l10n/app_localizations_he.dart` - Hebrew translations
- `lib/l10n/app_localizations_en.dart` - English translations

### Key Methods:
- `_skipOnboarding()` - Handles skip functionality without marking completion
- `_completeOnboarding()` - Handles normal completion flow
- `_getPages()` - Returns localized onboarding pages

This implementation ensures users see the tutorial every time they launch the app while providing them the flexibility to skip it when needed, all in their preferred language.
